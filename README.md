## tasks which need to be accomplished

- print pictures for the bags based on the information in the database

- let the person enter the lego id on the instructions -> make a search API request -> person selects which set it is
  - fetch all the parts via the API and paginate through to get all the parts of the set
  - insert individual entities for each of the parts and in case the quantity is greater than 1, create multiple `:set-contains-part` entities

- look up parts by their lego id and then choose the color
  - then display the sets this part belongs to and give us an option to assign it to one.

- how can I have different views and track what kind of view is being displayed? watch an atom like it https://electric.hyperfiddle.net/user.tutorial-7guis-5-crud!CRUD and does that work for a multiplayer setup?

- sort sets by
  - number of absolute parts

- be able to go to the part detail view where it's displayed in which other set it's part of and in what quantity

---

## Strategies for sorting

My goal is to finish smaller sets first.

For this I'd make a group of lego-sets as an entity and then I can query their parts and the frequency that they appear in.
Eg. I'll create a group for a small race car and a fire engine. Then I look at all their black parts. With this I then rough sort the black parts into buckets that match the parts needed for this set. With every part found I'll update the parts entities belonging to this set indicating that it's found and assigned.


## next steps

- [x] remove all the 8062-1 sets with their associated parts
- for all the existing sets,
  - [x] delete their associated parts
  - [x] and re-fetch them with a proper sleep in between the calls
- [x] re-add this 8062-1 manually
