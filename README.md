## tasks which need to be accomplished

- print pictures for the bags based on the information in the database

- let the person enter the lego id on the instructions -> make a search API request -> person selects which set it is
  - fetch all the parts via the API and paginate through to get all the parts of the set
  - insert individual entities for each of the parts and in case the quantity is greater than 1, create multiple `:set-contains-part` entities

- look up parts by their lego id and then choose the color
  - then display the sets this part belongs to and give us an option to assign it to one.

- how can I have different views and track what kind of view is being displayed? watch an atom like it https://electric.hyperfiddle.net/user.tutorial-7guis-5-crud!CRUD and does that work for a multiplayer setup?
